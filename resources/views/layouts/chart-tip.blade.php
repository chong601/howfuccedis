    Tip: These charts are interactive. You can:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Click and drag on any chart left and right</li>
    <li>Shift+scroll wheel to adjust chart zoom</li>
    <li>Shift+click and drag within the chart to show specific region of the chart</li>
</ul>
<p>
    All charts are in sync to each other so moving one chart will adjust all charts at once.
